\description{
Function used to simulate a data set to illustrate
the use of \code{funcharts}.
By default, it creates a data set with three functional covariates,
a functional response generated as a function of the
three functional covariates
through a function-on-function linear model,
and a scalar response generated as a function of the
three functional covariates
through a scalar-on-function linear model.
This function covers the simulation study in Centofanti et al. (2021)
for the function-on-function case and also simulates data in a similar way
for the scalar response case.
It is possible to select the number of functional covariates,
the correlation function type for each functional covariate
and the functional response, moreover
it is possible to provide manually the mean and variance functions
for both functional covariates and the response.
In the default case, the function generates in-control data.
Additional arguments can be used to generate additional
data that are out of control,
with mean shifts according to the scenarios proposed
by Centofanti et al. (2021).
Each simulated observation of a functional variable consists of
a vector of discrete points equally spaced between 0 and 1 (by default
150 points),
generated with noise.
