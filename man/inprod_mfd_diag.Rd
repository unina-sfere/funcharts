\title{Inner product of two multivariate functional data objects, for each observation}
\usage{
inprod_mfd_diag(mfdobj1, mfdobj2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mfdobj1}{A multivariate functional data object of class \code{mfd}.}

\item{mfdobj2}{A multivariate functional data object of class \code{mfd},
with the same number of functional variables and observations as \code{mfdobj1}.
If NULL, then \code{mfdobj2=mfdobj1}. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
It calculates the inner product of two multivariate functional data objects.
The main function \code{inprod} of the package \code{fda} calculates inner products among
all possible couples of observations.
This means that, if \code{mfdobj1} has \code{n1} observations
and \code{mfdobj2} has \code{n2} observations,
then for each variable \code{n1 X n2} inner products are calculated.
However, often one is interested only in calculating the \code{n} inner products
between the \code{n} observations of \code{mfdobj1} and the corresponding \code{n}
observations of \code{mfdobj2}. This function provides this "diagonal" inner products only,
saving a lot of computation with respect to using \code{fda::inprod} and then extracting the
diagonal elements.
Note that the code of this function calls a modified version of \code{fda::inprod()}.
